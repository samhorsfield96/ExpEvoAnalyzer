# ExpEvoAnalyzer
A snakemake pipeline to analyse experimental evolution data.

ExpEvoAnalyzer uses [shovill](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) for assembly, [bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta) for genome annotation, [SKA2](https://github.com/bacpop/ska.rust) for variant calling, and [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) for variant annotation.

ExpEvoAnalyzer can either be run on assemblies or paired-end reads, and works with gzipped files.

ExpEvoAnalyzer filters variants caused by assembly errors by mapping reference reads back to the original assembly, and filtering any shared variants.

## Dependencies:

* python>=3.9
* bakta
* ska2
* spades
* pandas
* biopython
* snakemake>=9.6
* snpeff
* shovill
* pyvcf
* gzip

## To install:

Install the required packages using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)/[mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba):

```
git clone https://github.com/samhorsfield96/ExpEvoAnalyzer.git
cd ExpEvoAnalyzer
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate expevoanalyzer
```

## Running:

ExpEvoAnalyzer expects all reads to be trimmed (adapters removed) if provided. ExpEvoAnalyzer can also be run with assemblies.

Update `config.yaml` to specify workflow and directory paths.
- `output_dir`: path to output directory. Does not need to exist prior to running.
- `input_dir`: path to directory containing paired-end FASTQ files (gzipped or uncompressed). 
- `reference_reads_R1`: path to FASTQ of read 1 for the reference isolate. Can be provided in absence of `reference_assembly`.
- `reference_reads_R2`: path to FASTQ of read 2 for the reference isolate. Can be provided in absence of `reference_assembly`.
- `reference_assembly`: paths to FASTA of reference assembly (if already generated). Can be provided in absence of `reference_reads_R1` and `reference_reads_R1`.
- `shovill_params`: additional parameters for [shovill](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) e.g. `--trim`
- `ksize`: integer, k-mer size used for [SKA2](https://github.com/bacpop/ska.rust)
- `snpEFF_config`: path to SnpEff config file, usually `scripts/snpEff.config`
- `bakta_db`: path to [bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta) database. This needs to be downloaded and updated prior to running (see [here](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta#database-download))

Run snakemake:

```
snakemake --cores <cores>
```

## Outputs:

All workflows output the following directories/files:
- `shovill`: assembly files of reference strain.
- `bakta`: bakta annotations of reference strain.
- `reads_list`: input files for SKA2.
- `ska_build`: SKA2 sketches of non-reference read files.
- `ska_map`: VCF files generated by SKA2, non-reference read files mapped to reference assembly.
- `snpeff`: annotated VCFs generated by SnpEff.
- `annotated_variants.csv`: presence/absence matrix of variants in non-reference files, annotated by SnpEff
- `logs`: log files.
